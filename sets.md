Week 18 Review: The Set
====================

Today we're going to talk about `set`s, a data structure that I mistakenly covered in
[Week 14 review](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/python-fro-beginners/discussions/513db1703a03bbfc0b0006f2)
being under the impression that it was the topic of one the lessons in the Python track.
In fact it isn't, but it should since it's a nicely useful object.



P.S. Some technicalities. What I described refers to Python 2.7.x as well as Python 3.x.x
The set was first introduced in Python 2.3 as a library (you had to `import` in order
to be able to use it in your programs). In Python 2.6 it became a built-in type, that is part of the Python language
(and the old library has been renamed to `sets` and deprecated). Only with Python 2.7 the `{}` notation has been
introduced (so, you won't be able to use it in some online IDEs that are still stuck to older versions of
Python, and you may even have to `import sets` if the version is <2.6).
For Python 3 users, same as Python 2.7 except that obviously `sets` has been removed.
