Week 25 Review: Importing Modules
============

Hi!
Today we're going to talk about modules. A module, in its essence, is no more than a file containing Python code. When you're working on a big project, you might want to split your code in smaller modules to keep it manageable; additionally, using modules makes possible to reuse the same code in several projects.

The most prominent case of reuse is obviously the (Python Standard Library)[http://docs.python.org/2/library/]. Python comes with a set of standard modules that add a lot of useful features to those built into the language.
